## What is Covtact?

COVID-19 spreads through human to human interaction. Sadly, one of the most effective measures to stop it, is to reduce your contacts as much as possible.

But still, sometimes you need or want to meet other people, outside your very own household. In that case, you can infect others or be infected, even if none of you feel any symptoms. Sometimes, you will only learn later. In that case, it is important you notive people you had contact during the last days, so they can self-isolate and stop spreading the illness.

Covtact allows you, to keep a diary with whom you had contact. You can quickly add a name and a date. Afterwards, if need be, you can look back whom you met and inform them. Covtact is different than other contact tracing apps, in that it not requires you both to alwys run it, and change the information between each other. It requires you to take the time to add the contact, which you think where close enough to matter, manually.

Covtact also doesn't store your informations centrally, or to share it somehow automatically. Instead, all data you entered are securely encrypted with an password you set, and are only stored locally on your device. So nobody, except you, can read it.

## Development

This project is MIT licensed. If you want to improve it, you can! Issues and PRs welcome.

It is a React project, written in TypeScript and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Fast recap: In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
